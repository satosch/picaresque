        Our curatorial Project "Picaresque" started in 2022.
        The title was named after one of the famous Spanish genres of literature back in the 16th Century. The purpose of this project is to reconstruct the existing philosophy of art by presenting to the world, from our perspective, the trends in art that are changing at an accelerated pace, as well as the extremely common spread of the Internet and SNS and the high speed of the media, or micro trends that cannot be captured by existing galleries and other institutions. The protagonists of picaresque literature were not only not of noble lineage, but were also thugs and ruffians, exposing the contradictions that existed in society. In this project, we would like to present art works that have not been exposed to the sun as protagonists to society in various ways.
